# VulnerableWebsite
VulnerableWebsite is a purposefully vulnerable web application intended to be used as a Capture The Flag (CTF) challenge. Through a series of tasks, users will navigate through different layers of security (or the lack thereof) to capture the flag, learning and applying various cybersecurity concepts along the way.

# Overview

*The challenge begins at the login page, where participants need to find the credentials for the admin user to proceed. As they progress, they will be required to crack passwords, gather open-source intelligence (OSINT) from user profiles, and answer security questions based on the information they've collected. Each step builds upon the previous, leading to a comprehensive learning experience in web application security.*
